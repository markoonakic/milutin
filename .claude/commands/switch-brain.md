# Switch Brain Command

Switch the active Obsidian vault by updating all configuration files to point to a new vault path.

## New Vault Path
$ARGUMENTS

## Instructions

1. **Validate the path format:**
   - Ensure $ARGUMENTS is a full absolute path
   - If the path looks invalid or incomplete, ask the user to provide the full path

2. **Update `.claude/settings.md`:**
   - Read the file at `.claude/settings.md` (in the current project directory)
   - Replace the `VAULT_BASE_PATH=` value with: `VAULT_BASE_PATH=$ARGUMENTS`
   - Use the Edit tool to make this change

3. **Update `.mcp.json`:**
   - Read the file at `.mcp.json` (in the current project directory)
   - Find all vault path references in the `smart-connections` server configuration
   - Replace the old vault path with: `$ARGUMENTS`
   - Use the Edit tool to update the `OBSIDIAN_VAULT_PATH` environment variable in the smart-connections configuration

4. **Confirm completion:**
   - Display a summary of what was changed
   - Show the new vault path that's now configured
   - **IMPORTANT**: Display this final message to the user:

```
✅ Vault configuration updated successfully!

New vault path: $ARGUMENTS

⚠️  RESTART REQUIRED: You must restart Claude Code for these changes to take effect.

The MCP servers (MCP_DOCKER and smart-connections) will connect to the new vault after restart.
```

## Notes
- This command updates both the settings and MCP server configuration
- Changes only take effect after restarting Claude Code
- Make sure the specified vault path exists and contains a `.obsidian` folder
