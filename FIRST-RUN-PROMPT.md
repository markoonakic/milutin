## The Prompt:

```
Hello! This is my first time using the Milutin system with my Obsidian vault. I need you to:

1. **Analyze my current vault structure**:
   - Run /analyze-kb to generate the knowledge base analysis
   - Count notes in each directory (Zettelkasten, Input, Journal, Output, MOCs)
   - Identify any structural issues or missing folders

2. **Scan my existing content**:
   - Look at what topics/domains I already have notes on
   - Identify clusters of related notes (groups of 5+ on similar topics)
   - Check if any clusters are large enough for MOCs (15+ notes)

3. **Set up the changelog system**:
   - Ensure .meta/Changelogs/ directory exists in my vault
   - Create the master CHANGELOG.md if it doesn't exist
   - Explain the changelog workflow

4. **Test all systems**:
   - Verify you can read from my vault
   - Test semantic search capabilities
   - Confirm MCP servers are working
   - Test file creation in Zettelkasten/

5. **Run initial discovery**:
   - Use connection-finder on one of my most developed topics
   - Show me what patterns already exist in my notes
   - Identify the most connected notes (potential hub notes)

6. **Provide recommendations**:
   - What should I focus on capturing next?
   - Which clusters could become MOCs?
   - What synthesis opportunities exist?
   - Suggested workflow for my domain (DevOps/Infrastructure)

7. **Create first session changelog**:
   - Document this initialization session
   - Create: CHANGELOG - System Initialization YYYY-MM-DD.md

Please work systematically through each step and let me know what you find!
```
